# Pathfinding-Algorithm-Visualiser
Pathfinding Algorithm Visualiser created using Python, Pygame and Object Oriented Programming.

Algorithms implemented include, A* and Dijkstra's.

Allows the user to select start and end points within the GUI, add barriers within the grid and select a specified search algorithm to visualize its progression from the start node to the end node and finally displays the shortest path.
